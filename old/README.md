`cardinal`
==========

embr's toy for playing with smartcards.

The goal is to be able to pick up any smartcard, point `cardinal` at it, and have it figure out what the card is, what you can do with it, what data is on it, and let me interface with it.

Right now it only implements parts of EMV (payment cards), next up are MRTDs, Estonian e-IDs, OpenPGP and PIV (in no particular order).
